# Synapse
A unified platform designed to help dedicated learners master any subject by integrating planning, execution, reflection, and progress visualization into a seamless, motivational workflow.

It's built on three core pillars:

The Planner (Task & Routine Management): This is where you define what you'll do and when. It's more than a simple to-do list. It understands the structure of learning.

The Dashboard (Progress Visualization): This is your mission control. It provides at-a-glance, motivational feedback on your consistency, depth, and momentum.

The Knowledge Hub (Integrated Notes): This is where you synthesize information. Itâ€™s not just a notepad; it's a personal knowledge base that's contextually linked to your tasks and subjects.
